Situation:
_______________________________________________________________________

You are conducting the product sign-off meeting with cross-functional stakeholders and scrum teams (10+ people) and the product
being tested is expected to go live at the end of this sprint. One of the cross-functional stakeholders shared the feedback below at the meeting.
Feedback: I don’t think the product we just tested is good enough to go live. It needs to send daily push notification reminding users to open 
and use the product feature being launched.

Assumption for exercise-sake: Notification feature (of any sort) is not in the MVP scope. Your goal is to understand the user journey within the 
product better after the launch to define the trigger and other details to introduce later. Use the template (provided in the “starter” section) to share your answers.
