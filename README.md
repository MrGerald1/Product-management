# Product-management
I am glad to share that I have compgraduated from Udacityâ€™s Product Management Nanodegree program. I was keen to get some skin in the game to understand how businesses are built and this Product management degree was an excellent resource to learn this. It was a truly a great learning journey during these last 4 months. 

I built four projects for LinkedIn to help college graduates get jobs. I was responsible for the business and product strategy, design, user experience and product delivery with other stakeholders for the development of the product. 

Through the program, I learned to:

- Pitch a product vision
- Run a design sprint
- Manage a product development process
- Launch a product to market
