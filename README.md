# Product-management
I am glad to share that I have graduated from Udacityâ€™s Product Management Nanodegree program. I was keen to get some skin in the game to understand how businesses are built and this Product management degree was an excellent resource to learn this. It was a truly a great learning journey during these last 4 months. 

I built four projects for LinkedIn to help college graduates get jobs. I was responsible for the business and product strategy, design, user experience and product delivery with other stakeholders for the development of the product. 

Through the program, I learned to:

- **Pitch a product vision.** I conducted research and created a presentation on the strategy behind creating a referral application for LinkedIn and the potential for expanding to a new target segment.
- **Run a design sprint.** I went through the design process, created prototypes and designs for the application as well as the main features using Plot.io and Figma. Prototype mock can be found in the presentation.
- **Manage a product development process.** I went through a product sprint incorporating AGILE principles of scrum and Kanban. I provided solutions to handle and manage different stakeholders during the product development process.
- **Launch a product to market.** Prepared for the product launch process. Created materials including an updated PRD, User Guides, Marketing / Pricing Guides, Sales & Customer Support Guides, and the Launch Email.
